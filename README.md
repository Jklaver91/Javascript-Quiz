## Description
    This challenge required us to use DOM manipulation to create a javascript quiz within the browser. This was accomplished using JS alongside things like Bootstrap. Containers were created and based on user input presenting questions to the user, adding and subtracting time for correct and incorrect answers.After the quiz times out or is finished the user is presented with their score and the ability to restart the quiz as well as input initials to save the score and display it on the landing site of the page.
